### Colour

A descending colour palette was chosen to as a reflection of the latter part of the website's name - "Dive". This was considered to create the imagery of the user diving into mental health information and the deeper they go in the website the more the learn.

Moreover, the choice of descending blue represented ocean colours with an attempt to emphasize how deep mental health can be.
